Features Left:
-Scroll-Up Text --> Last

-Chat Log --> Needed for the other parts, so high priority. use a struct similar to allUsers. will need to change up the older sockets too

-Change Username+Color --> must update both user list and msg area

-Bold Msgs --> should be easy, just the users own msgs are bolded in the h4 tag. last priority

-Cookies --> will need to do reserach

Emoji --> best to handle these within the chatApp (clientside) not server side
