Features Left:
-Scroll-Up Text --> Last

-Chat Log --> Needed for the other parts, so high priority. use a struct similar to allUsers. will need to change up the older sockets too

-Change Username+Color --> must update both user list and msg area

-Bold Msgs --> should be easy, just the users own msgs are bolded in the h4 tag. last priority

-Cookies --> will need to do reserach

Emoji --> best to handle these within the chatApp (clientside) not server side

Minor --> give componets proper keys

-----------------------------------------------------

Good News! We can create a unique sessionID identifier, pass THAT to client, and set that to its cookie, IF it doesnt have sessionID already
then we retrieve it on server side. this way we can load in info

also, pls make cookie on server side.
